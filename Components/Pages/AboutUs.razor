                    <p>We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in Kansas City, MO. We are the only local nonprofit in the Kansas
                        City metro with a mission for all children to be celebrated on their birthdays!</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title mt-4">What we do</h2>
                    <p>We partner with local social service agencies to identify families who have children with an
                        upcoming birthday. Through our program, underrepresented families are empowered to shop with
                        dignity in the Birthday Market for their children’s gifts, books, birthday cards, and sweet
                        treats!</p>
